5	Main findings
Based on their auditing findings each subgroup presented main findings and summary of those findings is presented here.
5.1	Segmentation
The PCI DSS audit criteria’s scope contains everything that is involved in processing or transferring of cardholder data. Thus segmentation, on top of being a sound cyber security policy in its own right, directly affects which parts of the organizations network are also part of the cardholder data environment (CDE). Only the CDE has to be audited with the PCI DSS criteria.
First of all, the services that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet are not facing Internet. Only the external ones, like email, web page and external name services are available. Everything else from the Internet to DMZ and to the rest of the Internal network of Ldil has been explicitly blocked.
Also, all the services that need to connect from one network segment to another have been separately defined so that network-wise they can only connect to their intended destinations. Also, all the undefined connections from the DMZ to other parts of the Ldil’s network have been explicitly blocked.
Connectivity from different network segments inside Ldil’s network has also been restricted to minimum, with down to nominating specific address’ and applications when possible. Using the report Cyber Security Implementation (for the Ldil –store) it’s not clear which parts or which computers belong to CDE. For example, the connection from the store Point Of Sale (POS) device is not defined. Also, the report doesn't make any remark about the settings of the firewall(s) at the branch stores.
